        # Class Tutor gave feed back that the idea is good but there are existing apps that do the same thing already, so I should think about
        # Some innovative features to make it stand out or different to existing applications - Barcode scanner (?)
        # Scrolling feature (carosel) - 
        # After exploring existing apps with similar features, none shared the same purpose as my initial idea 
                # none had the release date or the storage location component
